# Daemon-MultiClient-Application
Multithreading application using C language 


An application of a Daemon Server based on MultiThreanding, semaphores, and a shared memory bettween clients and Daemon
the application was built with C language. to lanch the up there's a makefile . so you just got enter the command 
# make 
on your CMD 
the projects contains a header named file.h where i putted all the prototypes of the application. and to define these fonctions i used a file.c 
so all the necessery fonctions of the project are in file.c besides the thread fonction that is defined in Demon.c
to really understand the concept of the app you should read the PDF file ( written in french :( ).
